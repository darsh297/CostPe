Sure, I can guide you through setting up a cron job to send reminders to users who forgot to submit their work reports. Here's a step-by-step process along with five questions to help tailor the solution to your needs:

    Identify the Reminder Timing:
        Question: At what time do you want the reminders to be sent out?
        Example Answer: I want the reminders to be sent out at 10:00 PM every day.

    Define the Logic to Identify Users with Pending Work Reports:
        Question: How do you determine which users have forgotten to submit their work reports?
        Example Answer: Users with pending work reports are those who have not submitted a report for the previous day.

    Set Up the Cron Job:
        Question: Do you have access to the server where the application is hosted?
        Example Answer: Yes, I have access to the server.

    Create a Rake Task to Send Reminders:
        Question: What information do you want to include in the reminder emails?
        Example Answer: The reminder email should include a message stating that the user forgot to submit their work report and instructions on how to do so.

    Test the Cron Job and Rake Task:
        Question: How will you ensure that the reminders are being sent out correctly?
        Example Answer: I will test the cron job by scheduling it to run at a specific time and checking if the reminders are sent to the correct users.

Based on the answers to these questions, here's a brief overview of the implementation steps:

    Identify Reminder Timing:
        Schedule a cron job to run a rake task at 10:00 PM every day.

    Define Logic to Identify Users with Pending Work Reports:
        Create a method in the WorkreportsController or a separate service object to identify users who have not submitted work reports for the previous day.

    Set Up the Cron Job:
        Edit the crontab file on your server to schedule the rake task to run at 10:00 PM every day.

    Create a Rake Task:
        Create a rake task that queries the database for users with pending work reports and sends reminder emails to them.

    Test the Cron Job and Rake Task:
        Test the cron job by scheduling it to run at the specified time and verify that reminder emails are sent to the correct users.
